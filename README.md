# Full Feature Flag sample (with DevOps practices applied)

I'm creating this repo with the idea of having a full sample of Feature Flags
in action. By action, I mean having:

- A Web App with a feature to be implemented
- Feature Flag coding already in place
- ARM templates for deploying the sample infrastructure
- Good engineering practices
- A step-by-step tutorial for you to *feel* the benefits of the technique

For you to have all the resources set up for this set of samples,
see [Provisioning Resources](docs/00-provisioning-resources.md).

## Engineering practices reference
